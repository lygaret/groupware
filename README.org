Tribe is a calendar/contacts/notes sharing server for small, mostly trusted groups,
like school-aged families, polycules and co-parenting groups.

* technical

- an instance manages a single group, this isn't intended as SaaS
- group can have members, which have more or less the same rights as each other
- group can have non-members, which are first-class invitees etc, but don't have rights

- WebDAV for shared file storage
    - notion like editor for these files, maybe just for markdown
- CalDAV for calendars
- CardDAV for contacts
- Bot framework for ingest via chat
    - Telegram, SMS, Signal, WhatsApp?
    
* status

** DONE webdav (resources + properties)
** TODO webdav (rework to newer rfc)
** TODO webdav (acl, principal, lock/unlock)
** TODO caldav (figure out storage for events, since we have to process ical as xml in some places)
